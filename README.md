Hi! Welcome to this GitHub repository where we will learn how to perform an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Linear Regression based on a statistical learning approach.

Linear regression is a commonly used statistical technique in data science for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. OLS regression is a popular type of linear regression that minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the predicted values and the actual values of the dependent variable.

In this repository, you will find a Jupyter Notebook that will guide you through the process of creating and interpreting a linear regression model using Python programming language and the popular statsmodels library. We will start by learning about the basics of OLS regression and how to interpret the results of a regression analysis.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a solid understanding of OLS regression and be able to create and interpret your own linear regression models. This tutorial is designed for beginner data scientists, so no prior experience in regression analysis is required.

Linear regression is a powerful and widely used tool in data science and machine learning, and is often considered as a fundamental building block for more advanced methods like neural networks. Understanding linear regression is crucial because it allows us to model and analyze the relationships between variables in a simple and interpretable way. Linear regression also provides a solid foundation for more complex modeling techniques, such as logistic regression, polynomial regression, and many others.

Moreover, the interpretability and simplicity of linear regression models make them a valuable tool in many applications, from marketing and finance to healthcare and social sciences. By mastering linear regression, you will be equipped with a powerful and versatile tool for analyzing and modeling a wide range of real-world problems.
