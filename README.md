# Introduction to Linear Regression with Python: How to Impress with Basic Statistics

Hi and welcome! In this repository you will find a comprehensive introduction to Linear Regression with Python. In this tutorial, we will focus on Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Linear Regression, an essential machine learning model for aspiring data scientists. While not mandatory, having a basic understanding of statistics would be beneficial for grasping the concepts discussed.

By following this tutorial, you will develop the following skills:

1. Creating a linear regression model using Python and the statsmodels library.
2. Interpreting the results of a regression analysis.
3. Making assumptions about the linear regression model and evaluating its validity.
4. Utilizing the model for making predictions and performing inference.
5. Conducting diagnostic analysis to assess the model's performance and identify potential issues.

Linear regression is a widely-used statistical technique that establishes a relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. OLS regression, in particular, minimizes the sum of squared differences between the predicted and actual values of the dependent variable. Understanding linear regression is crucial for constructing more advanced models and analyzing real-world problems in various domains, such as marketing, finance, healthcare, and social sciences.

This repository includes a Jupyter Notebook that presents a step-by-step guide to creating and interpreting a linear regression model using Python and the statsmodels library. The tutorial is designed with beginners in mind, so no prior experience in regression analysis is required. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a solid understanding of linear regression, gain the ability to create your own models, and effectively interpret their results.
