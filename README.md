# "Introduction to Linear Regression with Python: A Beginner's Tutorial"

Hi!Welcome to this GitHub repository where you will learn how to perform an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Linear Regression using Python, an essential tool for every data scientist beginner. By following this tutorial, you will gain the following skills:

Create a linear regression model using Python and the statsmodels library.
Interpret the results of a regression analysis.
Make assumptions about the linear regression model and assess its validity.
Use the model to make predictions and perform inference.
Perform diagnostic analysis to assess the model's performance and identify potential issues.
Linear regression is a popular statistical technique that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. OLS regression is a specific type of linear regression that minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values of the dependent variable. Understanding linear regression is essential for building more advanced models and analyzing real-world problems in various fields, including marketing, finance, healthcare, and social sciences.

In this repository, you will find a Jupyter Notebook that provides a step-by-step guide to creating and interpreting a linear regression model using Python and statsmodels. The tutorial is designed for beginners, so no prior experience in regression analysis is required. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a solid understanding of linear regression, be able to create your own models, and interpret their results.
